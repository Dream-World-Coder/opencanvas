-- [] interested topics add in profile settings
-- [] saved posts page ->> liked & other collections
-- [] make dynamic sitemap
-- [] study concept of react query and remake the whole
-- [] gap button in editor
-- [] UI-UX and design upgrade needed
-- [] if post.type !== article then only show the back button, [else table of contents is creating problems]
-- [] Magazine [week - month - year] : best articles or collections [any one], best stories & poems [in different sections[max 8]]
-- [] caching is available in sever environments, but something similar can be made, i.e. if same arguments then same result, no api call needed, [store the previous in some ref / context]
-- [] I think another attribute `timesFetched` can be added, to easily cache proper posts, its not necessary only a more fetched post will always be on trending,
-- [] loading when liking disliking a post
-- [] drag & drop not functional in regular image upload inside articles
-- [] do mo use const <var> in components, use useref or usestate, [table of contents component]

-- [] Image viewer -> chobi boro kore dekhar moto jinis, like in gfg, click korle dekha jabe,
** maybe protita image inside article ke ekta onClick dite hobe just and Toaster er moto ekta viewer component niche laagiye debo, and then see enlarged image on click

-- first i have to learn it that how much does it help, and whats wrong when fetching a author as soon as post, it might be better than changing all posts if username or profile pic changes,

^^^ ISSUES: open hashes, eg `##` on preview mode of editor creating errors

In dark mode, heading and texts are in same color which looks bad, ViewPost

* less imp
    [-] html in export formats
    [-] mermaid support
    [-] beginner totorial vid
    [-] better pdf quality and page breaks
    [-] optimisations to load faster
    [-] Keyboard shortcuts for differnt formats,

^^^ MOTO: focused place, to publish individual works, groups can be formed though, publish reserch papers, stories, poems


-- issue: in md2pdf when in 2 window mode isPreview must always be false, but if we use the export during that time, then it will be turned on, so it will be better to close the the 2 window view first, when export pressed
