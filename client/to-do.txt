> use searchbar or the name of the page, like login instead of `opencanvas` logo in headers, as no need to go there after login


-- save & clear post id in local storage or some other place so that id does not creates different post id


-- use pop over instead of sheet in the writing-pad
-- [x] localhost for saving id
-- md2pdf route and public profile
-- [x] profile settings
-- [x] post & article view


-- [x] in private profile view options for post: 1.view[public view] 2.edit 3.delete


-- store postTitle, shortDescription also anong with it's id in currentUser.posts[], it will reduce db query a lot


-- use axios for tetching and for some common fetches use the src/services/dataService.js

-- no need for intermediate post preview [like in profilepage] ---
    only 2 states: normal & in view -- less dbQuery

    on profilePage: choose between the 3 stages mentioned earlier ->
        if `view`:open in postViewer
        if `edit` open in writingPad with properId
        if `delete` confirm & delete


-- add useStrict in main.jsx if needed

-- add specific schemadata in About & contact page

// img options are for pdf export only

-- in profile prevent remap of existing elements when more are loaded

-- dark mode in imgUpload page

-- last 5 logins in /profile/settings


-- no need of photo gallery, its simply not for that level of photography
-- remove photography from keywords

-- mainly for written art
images in articles and thumbnails

-- 1 blog browser : only articles
-- 2 written posts : literature gallery

else focus will be gone by browsing different sections, here browse one type of thing

and in the feed, imgs will not be recommended or will be less recommended, they will be in the profile only

collections, imgs, books etc will not be in feed, will only gen when searched for.


issue: in md2pdf when in 2 window mode isPreview must always be false, but if we use the export during that time, then it will be turned on, so it will be better to close the the 2 window view first, when export pressed
