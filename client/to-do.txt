-- [] index the db
-- [] comments
-- [] interested topics add in settings

-- [] saved page ->> liked & other collections
-- [] make dynamic sitemap

--- [] study concept of react query and remake the whole

-- [] post view page for private posts
-- [] in profile footer add `opencanvas`
-- [] gap button in editor
-- [] store fetched posts of feed [use context or cache]
-- [] UI-UX and design upgrade needed
-- [] sliding effect in header, highlight current route, and traverse the green box to other

-- [] Magazine [week - month - year] : best articles or collections [any one], best stories & poems [in different sections[max 8]]
-- [] caching is available in sever environments, but something similar can be made, i.e. if same arguments then same result, no api call needed, [store the previous in some ref / context]

-- [] I think another attribute `timesFetched` can be added, to easily cache proper posts, its not necessary only a more fetched post will always be on trending,

-- [] drag & drop not functional in regular image upload inside articles
-- [] Image viewer -> chobi boro kore dekhar moto jinis, like in gfg, click korle dekha jabe,
** maybe protita image inside article ke ekta onClick dite hobe just and Toaster er moto ekta viewer component niche laagiye debo, and then see enlarged image on click

-- remove post.author things as much as  possible, fetch author, else have to update them
-- only store author's name & image in the post, nothing else; fetch them in viewPost page,
as in feed page only name & pic is sufficient, not username, also has to be updated
-- first i have to learn it that how much does it help, and whats wrong when fetching a author as soon as post, it might be better than changing all posts if username or profile pic changes,

* less imp
    html in export formats
    mermaid support
    beginner totorial vid
    better pdf quality and page breaks
    optimisations to load faster
    Keyboard shortcuts for differnt formats,

^^^ MOTO: focused place, to publish individual works, groups can be formed though, publish reserch papers, stories, poems


-- issue: in md2pdf when in 2 window mode isPreview must always be false, but if we use the export during that time, then it will be turned on, so it will be better to close the the 2 window view first, when export pressed
