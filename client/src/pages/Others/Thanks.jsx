<div className="text-4xl mb-8 underline decoration-2 decoration-stone-600">
    Meeting at Night
</div>
The grey sea and the long black land;
<br />
And the yellow half-moon large and low;
<br />
And the startled little waves that leap
<br />
In fiery ringlets from their sleep,
<br />
As I gain the cove with pushing prow,
<br />
And quench its speed iâ€™ the slushy sand.
<br />
<br />
Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;
<br />
Three fields to cross till a farm appears;
<br />
A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch
<br />
And blue spurt of a lighted match,
<br />
And a voice less loud, through its joys and fears,
<br />
Than the two hearts beating each to each!
<br />
