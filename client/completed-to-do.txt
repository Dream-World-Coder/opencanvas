    on profilePage: choose between the 3 stages mentioned earlier ->
        if `view`:open in postViewer
        if `edit` open in writingPad with properId
        if `delete` confirm & delete

-- [x] in more from author section same posts are staying again and again, cuz they are not refetched, so the solution will be to force shut the drawer and clean the html/i mean stateVariable,,, when new post loads, so it has to be manually opened, and if it is not

-- [+] UI-UX and design upgrade needed
-- [+] saved posts page ->> liked & other collections
-- [+] full commenting system
-- [+] if post.type !== article then only show the back button, [else table of contents is creating problems]
-- [+] special alert btn in profile pages to avoid confusion in public & private page, + admin


/*****************
data
_________________/
    book: collection of articles, stories, poems
    collection: coll of photos

    store postTitle, shortDescription also anong with it's id in currentUser.posts[], it will reduce db query a lot
    ~~~ NOT needed, habe to fetch author for related posts, have to use redis

    :page breaks will be easy: find the page length of html2pdf module and add
    <span className=html2pdf__page-break></span>
    need to check scale up/down s though, --> adding pages creates complexity in image handling, so no need to use it in web version

    img options are for pdf export only

    *** images are not posts, so no need to count them there, like post.type = post etc, they will be loaded differently




------
TL;DR
------
else focus will be gone by browsing different sections, here browse one type of thing

and in the feed, imgs will not be recommended or will be less recommended, they will be in the profile only

collections, imgs, books etc will not be in feed, will only gen when searched for.
